            `On top of the suggested elements, remember that one of the most important things for us to see in your style guides is your responsive rules and structures. Show us your column system, walk us through the logic of how you snap down to mobile, tell us about your breakpoints. Plain text is enough for a lot of this, but some visual diagrams go a long way - your style guide should be primarily a piece of visual communication.`

As designers we try to work from 'big to small' as often as possible, and we should have already tackled our biggest problems in the previous weeks - now is your time to focus on small details and 1%ers. This means you can keep the scope of your testing small and precise. Consider A/B testing small changes.`
